# Demo 1: Kart

This is a simple toy program to teach **namespaces** and **scope operator** `(::)`. Kart has a naming conflict because two different files used the same function name `compute()`. A namespace is a good solution because it is used to associate a set of variables, functions, classes, or other objects with an identifiable name.
