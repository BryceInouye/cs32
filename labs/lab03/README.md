# Lab 03

This lab is used to teach debugging techniques in C++ using the **GNU Debugger (GDB)** and **Valgrind**. Up until now, this class has mainly focused on object-oriented design and Test-Driven Development (TDD). These techniques were designed to give structure to the code and the development process. This structure reduces the chance
that a bug will sneak its way into your program. Even the most experienced programmer occasionally introduces
bugs into their program. Given that a significant portion of your time will likely be spent debugging your code,
we want to optimize the debugging process and make you more productive.
